# IMPORTANT NOTE
This project is currently unfinished. Development will be finished before 2023 is all that I can promise.

# How To Install
1. Download the repository.
2. Add the folder into your Unity assets folder.
3. Done, you can now use Gork to your advantadge.

# How To Use
Gork uses Scriptable Objects to save it's graphs. In order to get started, right click your projects panel and go to "Create/Gork Graph" to create a new gork graph. You can then call it whatever you want and open it by double clicking.

## The Interface
The interface is quite simple. You have a toolbar at the top for a few operations you can do, such as highlighting the file in your projects folder and saving your graph to another file.

Navigating is also quite simple. If you have used the Animator window or Shader Graph, you'll feel right at home!
Simply hold alt + LMB and move the mouse to navigate, use the scrollwheel to zoom in and out. Hold shift to select nodes in a box.

## Nodes
Gork graph uses nodes and is the meat of gork.

# Custom Nodes
Yes that's right! Gork allows you to create your own custom Gork Nodes!
